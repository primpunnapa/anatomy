Research: Development of a 3D and 2D Anatomy Learning Game
This research outlines the development of an interactive 3D anatomy learning tool and a 2D anatomy-based educational game, designed to enhance anatomical understanding through gamification. The 2D game includes four types of interactive exercises:
1. Matching images with names
2. Matching images with corresponding images
3. Matching names with functions
4. Flashcard-style quizzes
The game will be implemented as a web-based application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to ensure accessibility and interactivity.
Technology Implementation
HTML: Structures the web pages, including text, links, lists, forms, images, and videos. The website will be accessible across multiple web browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.
CSS: Defines the websiteâ€™s design and layout, including colors, spacing, backgrounds, borders, animations, and responsiveness to ensure a visually appealing and user-friendly interface.
JavaScript: Manages the game logic and interactivity, enabling dynamic functionalities such as matching exercises and flashcard quizzes to create an engaging user experience.
By integrating these technologies, the project aims to provide an interactive and immersive learning experience, making anatomy education more engaging and effective.
